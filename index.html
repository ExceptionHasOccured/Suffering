	<b>Report/Docs</b>
	<p>During this assignment I have produced a game using the Scratch programming language designed by MIT. The user interfaces with this game using the mouse pointer to point a snake in the direction of the food to increase its length, which increases its movement speed. In the modes Standard and Hardcore, a spin on this concept is added. Every 3-7/1-5 seconds (depending on mode), the snake will move in a random offset direction away from the mouse. This indicated by an audio queue and text being displayed in the top-right corner. In Hardcore, a further challenge is added by having the length slowly decrease overtime and if the length becomes 0, the game ends. This provides more of a challenge/objective to a game that would otherwise be completely endless. During this task, I produced images and sprites using the open-source image manipulation tool, GIMP and created audio in Audacity using the generate tone, fade-in/out and reverb functions. One major problem that I encountered was figuring out how to make multiple level for the game due the original concept of it being endless. This was solved by the addition of the multiple difficulties mentioned prior. A limitation that I also faced was the lack of complexities within the Scratch language, but this was mitigated by striping the game back to its base concepts and building from there.</p>
